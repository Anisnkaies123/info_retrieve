What are Coronaviruses?,,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to pneumonia (a more severe lung infection). A new coronavirus strain has been identified in Wuhan, China. The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) has caused cases of severe pneumonia in China and cases have been exported to other countries and cities."
How does COVID-19 spread? ,,"There is human to human transmission of COVID-19. For now, the evidence suggests spread is mostly via droplets. The virus is carried within droplets emitted from an infected person over a short distance, such as when the person coughs or sneezes. If these droplets come into contact with the eyes, nose or mouth of another person, directly or indirectly through hands that have come into contact with these droplets, the other person may become infected. Members of public are advised to remain vigilant and observe good personal hygiene practices.MOH is closely monitoring the evolving situation and members of public are advised to check the MOH website for updates."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,,"The symptoms of COVID-19 infection are similar to that of regular pneumonia. Typical symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath."
What is the treatment for COVID-19?,,Supportive treatment is provided based on the patient’s clinical condition. No proven specific treatment or anti-viral drug for COVID-19 is currently available.
Is the disease deadly? How is this compared to SARS?,,"The situation is evolving and many characteristics of the virus and how it may affect people are still unclear. However, current information suggests COVID-19 can cause severe disease and death in 2-3% of people with the infection, especially among the elderly and those people with underlying health problems or compromised immune systems."
What is the current public health travel advisory?,,"MOH advises travellers to avoid travel to Hubei province in China, and to defer all non-essential travel to mainland China."
"If I defer my travel to mainland China, will travel insurance cover my trip cancellation, postponement of flight tickets and hotels? How do I go about seeking refund? ",,You are advised to check with your respective travel insurance providers for information on coverage and compensation.
"How are the frontline workers, e.g., airline staff, healthcare workers, checkpoint staff, protected, to make sure that they do not get sick and spread the diseases?",,"Employees working in the various sectors would have received sector specific advisories, which include measures and precautionary measures that employees and employers can take. "
"With the new H5N1 outbreak in Hunan, China, are there additional precautions that we should take?  ",,"MOH is currently monitoring the development of H5N1 outbreak in China closely. While there have been isolated reports of H5N1 avian influenza infection in humans with presumed transmission from birds, there has not been any outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in humans or any evidence of human to human spread. Frozen and live poultry from China is not imported into Singapore. As such, the risk of any H5N1 outbreak in Singapore is low. However, members of public are advised to remain vigilant and observe good personal hygiene practices, such as washing hands with soap and water after contact with animals. They should also avoid the consumption of raw or undercooked meat. "
"Can organisations collect, use and disclose personal data (including NRIC/FIN/passport numbers) of visitors to premises for the purposes of contact tracing and other response measures in the event of a COVID-19 case?",," Organisations may collect personal data of visitors to premises for purposes of contact tracing and other response measures in the event of an emergency, such as during the outbreak of the COVID-19.In the event of a COVID-19 case, data can be collected, used and disclosed without consent to carry out contact tracing and other response measures, pursuant to sections 1(b) of the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), as this is necessary to respond to an emergency that threatens the life, health or safety of other individuals.As organisations may require NRIC/FIN/passport numbers to accurately identify individuals in the event of a COVID-19 case, organisations may collect visitors’ NRIC, FIN or passport numbers for this purpose.Organisations that collect such personal data must comply with the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA, such as making reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in their possession from unauthorised access or disclosure, and ensuring that the personal data is not used for other purposes without consent or authorisation under the law.Please click here for more FAQs on PDPA."
Who should wear a mask?  What kind of mask should I wear? ,,"For the general public who are not having any symptoms at all and are well, there is no requirement to wear a mask. As a good hygiene measure, people who are not well and have respiratory symptoms should wear a mask so that they do not spread any infection to other people. Anyone who has symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible, to make sure that they remain well. In the case of COVID-19, we know that the infection is spread through droplets. Wearing a mask will protect other people when someone with respiratory symptoms coughs or sneezes, as the mask would trap those droplets and prevent those droplets from spreading and disseminating."
Will Government be issuing masks for public? ,,"The Government will be distributing a pack of four masks to each household at distribution points. These are to be used when you are sick and need to see a doctor.The masks are made available from 01 Feb 2020 to 29 Feb 2020 at 88 Community Centres (CCs) and 654 Residents’ Committee (RC) Centres. You can click here, or check your RC noticeboards, digital display panels and social media platforms on when and where you should collect your masks. Priority will be given to areas with high numbers of vulnerable residents as well as rental block residents and Pioneer Generation residents."

Why don’t the Government get SingPost to distribute the masks? Why do I still need to collect them. ,,"Through collection at the RCs/CCs, we can ensure that those who need the masks get them. It reduces wastage, ensures the masks are safe and clean and also gives us the opportunity to answer any questions public may have."
Why is it not compulsory for frontline workers to wear masks?,,"Wearing a mask is only necessary when you are sick.Frontline staff, as with everyone else, are encouraged to be vigilant and observe good personal hygiene, including practicing frequent hand washing with soap and seeking immediate medical attention if unwell."
Why are SCDF medical crews seen to be wearing personal protective equipment when responding to emergencies?,,"The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) may implement precautionary measures to provide protection for its ambulance medical crews when dealing with emerging infectious diseases. Ambulance medical crews will don personal protective equipment (masks, gloves, gowns, caps and goggles) when responding to cases where patients have fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughs, wheezing or shortness of breath), and if they have travelled to China in the past 14 days. SCDF will also decontaminate its emergency ambulances after conveying such patients to the hospitals.These are precautionary measures, and not confirmation of a case of COVID-19."
"Why do healthcare professionals use N95 mask and don full personal protective equipment (PPE), including goggles, then? ",,"When dealing with infectious diseases, healthcare workers are required to wear the personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 and goggles, as they are in close contact with patients and their bodily fluids.As such, the PPE is needed to create a barrier between healthcare workers and the infectious agents from the patients, and to reduce the risk of transmitting micro-organisms from healthcare workers to patient(s)."
"If Singapore has enough masks, why can’t the Government release more masks from the national stockpile to retailers or distribute to households?",,"Data from cases in China suggests that the incubation period is up to 14 days.Therefore, travellers are advised to monitor their health closely for at least 2 weeks upon return to Singapore. You are advised to seek medical attention promptly if you feel unwell, and to also inform your doctor of your travel history."
"How long is the incubation period? If somebody travels to cities with confirmed cases, how many days of no-symptoms after the travel, will he/she then be considered clean and disease-free?",,"If you have recently travelled overseas, and are feeling unwell with a fever, or respiratory symptoms (such as cough, runny nose), please seek medical attention promptly. Wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of your visit, and avoid taking public transport.You may access the latest list of GP clinics through the MOH’s Directory of Licensed Healthcare Instituions or on the HealthHub mobile application, which is available on both iTunes and the Google Play Store. Healthcare practitioners have been informed and reminded to be vigilant for cases and how to manage them. All cases fulfilling the suspect case definition seen at various healthcare settings will be reported to MOH immediately and referred to hospitals for further assessment and treatment."
I would like to seek medical attention as I have a cough and runny nose and have recently travelled to the countries with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Should I go to the GP or do I have to go to A&E? ,,Contact tracing will be conducted to identify close contacts of the confirmed cases. 
Can MOH provide more information about the whereabouts of the confirmed cases? What if I suspect that I have been at the same place as the confirmed cases? What should I do?,,"There is no need to avoid places where suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been. The risk of infection from transient contact, such as in public places, is low. There is also currently no evidence widespread sustained community transmission. Members of public are advised to adopt good personal hygiene practices, such as washing your hands frequently with soap, and wearing a mask if you are unwell.NEA has been liaising closely with, and providing support to, residents and owners of premises, to ensure that the cleaning and disinfection of areas are done in accordance with NEA’s guidelines. For places exposed to confirmed cases, NEA has also been giving advice and supervising the cleaning and disinfection works. In addition, NEA has issued sanitation and hygiene advisories to premises and facilities with high public access like hotels, commercial buildings and F&B outlets, including hawker centres.Please click here for guidelines on environmental cleaning and disinfection of COVID-19 in non-healthcare premises and in residences."
My friend sent me a message to avoid a certain location as there has been a suspected case reported.

I stay near a Government Quarantine Facility. Should I be concerned?,,"There is a difference between a Leave of Absence (LOA) and a Quarantine Order (QO).A QO is a directive issued to individuals under the Infectious Diseases Act and thus have legal force with severe penalties for non-compliance.

This is with the aim of limiting the spread of the virus in the community. It is a legal order under the Infectious Diseases Act, with severe penalties for non-compliance. Quarantine usually occurs in the home but can also be served in dedicated Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs) or hospitals, should the individual not have suitable accommodation in Singapore.An LOA is a precautionary measure. We urge those who are on LOA to be socially responsible and comply with the LOA, to prevent possible transmissions of infections.Please refer to the Health Advisory for Persons Placed on Leave of Absence - 01 Feb 2020 for more details. "

What must I do when I am on a Leave of Absence (LOA)? How will this affect my household members?,,"There is as yet no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission. The four local cases are indicative of limited local transmission as they had a link to travellers from China even though they did not have any recent travel history to Mainland China. One case was a close contact of a case within the cluster of four, while three of the four cases had prolonged contact and interactions with recent travellers from Mainland China. Pending confirmation from the Chinese authorities, we understand that two members of this group of travellers were confirmed with the COVID-19 infection."
"With the four cases of local transmission, do we have a community transmission now?",,Widespread community transmission occurs when there are multiple cases or clusters where the source of infection cannot be identified. Limited local transmission occurs when cases are linked to a common source of infection that has been identified.
