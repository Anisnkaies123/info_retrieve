      "QN:  How does the PDPA benefit business? CORRECT:  The PDPA will strengthen Singapore's overall economic competitiveness and enhance Singapore's status as a trusted hub and choice location for global data management and processing services. The law will provide greater clarity on the rules and liabilities for businesses hosting personal data in Singapore. This will complement Singapore's existing strengths, such as geographical location, reliability and advanced telecommunications infrastructure, to create a conducive environment for the fast-growing global data management and data processing industries, such as cloud computing, to thrive in Singapore. The law will also put in place safeguards to protect data sets, which will help facilitate the smooth transfer of data to and from jurisdictions that have enacted data protection laws, many of which place obligations on organisations to ensure sufficient protection for transfer of data overseas. These safeguards serve as an attractive draw for cloud computing and business analytics activities to be located in Singapore. Compliance with the regime also sends a positive message and builds trust and credibility with consumers. Organisations will be able to assure their customers that their personal data will be sufficiently protected.\n",

They also cause less of a nuisance to delete when received, as compared to telephone calls, SMS and fax messages, which are more difficult for the individual to filter. Furthermore, the Spam Control Act (SCA) helps to complete the framework by setting out requirements in relation to the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages in bulk.

Generally, organisations may continue to use the personal data collected prior to the effective date of the data protection rules, unless the individual withdraws consent (if consent had previously been given) or indicates that he does not consent to such use of the personal data.  Consent will need to be obtained if the existing data is to be used for a new purpose different from the purpose for which it was collected, or if the existing data is to be disclosed to another organisation or individual, unless any exception applies. These exceptions are set out in the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA respectively. This includes exceptions catering to certain emergency situations, investigations, publicly available data or where the personal data is used for evaluative purposes.For example, if a company has been using its customer's personal data to provide after-sales customer support prior to the PDPA, it can continue to do so after the PDPA comes into effect, even if it did not obtain consent previously. However, if it now intends to use the same personal data for direct marketing where it had not collected the personal data for this purpose, consent will need to be obtained for such a purpose.

      "QN:  What is 'deemed consent'? CORRECT:  An individual is deemed to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data by an organisation if the individual voluntarily provides the personal data to the organisation for that purpose; and it is reasonable that he or she would do so.For example, an individual seeking medical treatment from a medical facility, such as a clinic or hospital, would voluntarily provide his or her personal data for such a purpose. He or she would be deemed to have consented to the collection and use of his or her personal data by the medical facility for that purpose.\n",
      "FAQ:  Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure. Consent can be obtained in a number of different ways. As a best practice, an organisation should obtain consent that is in writing or recorded in a manner that is accessible for future reference, for example, if the organisation is required to prove that it had obtained consent.  An organisation may also obtain consent verbally although it may correspondingly be more difficult for an organisation to prove that it had obtained consent. For such situations, it would be prudent for the organisation to document the consent in some way.\n",

However, in the event of a dispute, or an investigation by the PDPC, the onus will be on the organisation to prove that they have obtained 'clear and unambiguous' consent from the individual to be contacted for telemarketing activities.\n",

      "QN:  How much personal data can an organisation collect, use or disclose? CORRECT:  Under the PDPA, an organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data only for reasonably appropriate purposes under the circumstances. Organisations should notify individuals of the purposes for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data, and seek individuals' consent for the collection, use and disclosure of the personal data unless an exception under the PDPA applies. These exceptions are set out in the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA respectively.In this regard, organisations shall not, as a condition of supplying a product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service. If the organisation wishes to collect any additional personal data, the organisation may provide the individual the option of whether to consent to this.For example, an organisation selling a consumer product to individuals should not require them to reveal their annual household income as a condition of selling the product, although it may ask them to provide such personal data as an optional field.\n",
      "FAQ:  Organisations, General. While an organisation may not obtain consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data that is publicly available, it may still have to comply with all other obligations under the PDPA. In particular, the PDPA provides that an organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. In this regard, the circumstances would need to be taken into account in determining whether the purpose is appropriate. Given that publicly available personal data is already made available to the public, the PDPC recognises that for the purposes of the PDPA, it would not be practical nor useful to unduly limit the purposes for which such data can be collected, used or disclosed, unless it is for clearly unreasonable purposes, for example, the purpose is in violation of a law or would be harmful to the individual concerned. In any case, organisations should note that their collection, use or disclosure of personal data from publicly available sources may be bound by terms and conditions imposed and enforceable by the data source.\n",

CORRECT:  Generally, organisations may continue to use the personal data collected prior to the effective date of the data protection rules, unless the individual withdraws consent (if consent had previously been given) or indicates that he does not consent to such use of the personal data.  Consent will need to be obtained if the existing data is to be used for a new purpose different from the purpose for which it was collected, or if the existing data is to be disclosed to another organisation or individual, unless any exception applies.

      "QN:  How can an organisation obtain an individual's consent for the collection, use or disclosure of his or her personal data? CORRECT:  Consent can be obtained in a number of different ways. As a best practice, an organisation should obtain consent that is in writing or recorded in a manner that is accessible for future reference, for example, if the organisation is required to prove that it had obtained consent.  An organisation may also obtain consent verbally although it may correspondingly be more difficult for an organisation to prove that it had obtained consent. For such situations, it would be prudent for the organisation to document the consent in some way.\n",
      "FAQ:  Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure. Generally, organisations may continue to use the personal data collected prior to the effective date of the data protection rules, unless the individual withdraws consent (if consent had previously been given) or indicates that he does not consent to such use of the personal data.  Consent will need to be obtained if the existing data is to be used for a new purpose different from the purpose for which it was collected, or if the existing data is to be disclosed to another organisation or individual, unless any exception applies. These exceptions are set out in the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA respectively. This includes exceptions catering to certain emergency situations, investigations, publicly available data or where the personal data is used for evaluative purposes.For example, if a company has been using its customer's personal data to provide after-sales customer support prior to the PDPA, it can continue to do so after the PDPA comes into effect, even if it did not obtain consent previously. However, if it now intends to use the same personal data for direct marketing where it had not collected the personal data for this purpose, consent will need to be obtained for such a purpose. If the organisation wishes to use the personal data for telemarketing, it will separately have to ensure compliance with the DNC provisions under the PDPA.\n",
      "FAQ:  Organisations, General. While an organisation may not obtain consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data that is publicly available, it may still have to comply with all other obligations under the PDPA. In particular, the PDPA provides that an organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. In this regard, the circumstances would need to be taken into account in determining whether the purpose is appropriate. Given that publicly available personal data is already made available to the public, the PDPC recognises that for the purposes of the PDPA, it would not be practical nor useful to unduly limit the purposes for which such data can be collected, used or disclosed, unless it is for clearly unreasonable purposes, for example, the purpose is in violation of a law or would be harmful to the individual concerned. In any case, organisations should note that their collection, use or disclosure of personal data from publicly available sources may be bound by terms and conditions imposed and enforceable by the data source.\n",

An organisation may use personal data collected before 2 July 2014 for the purposes for which the personal data was collected, unless consent for such use is withdrawn or the individual has indicated to the organisation that he does not consent to the use of the personal data. If an organisation intends to disclose the personal data on or after the appointed day (other than disclosure that is necessarily part of the organisation's use of the personal data), the organisation must comply with the data protection provisions in relation to such disclosure.

Upon request, an organisation is generally required to correct an error or omission and send the corrected personal data to every other organisation to which the personal data was disclosed to within a year before the correction, unless the other organisation does not need the corrected personal data for any legal or business purpose. For example, the organisation may have disclosed a customer's name and address to a delivery company it engaged on a once-off basis to deliver a product that the customer purchased. Since the delivery has been completed, the organisation will not be required to send the corrected personal data to the delivery company.An organisation need not make a correction where it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a correction should not be made. In this case, the organisation shall annotate the personal data in its possession or under its control with the correction that is requested but not made.

      "QN:  Do organisations need to obtain consent from their employees before disclosing their personal data for the purpose of business merger or acquisition?  CORRECT:  The PDPA provides for certain exceptions to the requirement to obtain consent. One of these exceptions allows organisations to collect, use or disclose personal data without consent for the purpose of “business asset transactions”, subject to certain conditions. “Business asset transaction” is defined in the PDPA and can apply to mergers and acquisitions. For example, Organisation A is a prospective buyer of Organisation B. Organisation A can collect personal data without consent (and Organisation B can disclose without consent) about B’s employees, customers, directors or shareholders if it relates directly to the business with which the acquisition is concerned. The personal data must be necessary for Organisation A to determine whether to proceed with the acquisition, and organisations A and B must have entered into an agreement that requires A to use or disclose the personal data solely for purposes related to the acquisition.For full details, please refer to the Second Schedule, paragraph 1(p) and 3 and Fourth Schedule, paragraph 1(p) and 3 of the PDPA.\n",

However, organisations are prohibited from providing an individual access to his personal data if the provision of the data could reasonably be expected to: cause immediate or grave harm to the individual's safety or physical/mental health;threaten the safety or physical/mental health of another individual; reveal personal data about another individual; reveal the identity of another individual who has provided the personal data, and the individual has not consented to the disclosure of his or her identity; or be contrary to national interest. In addition, there are cases where organisations may deny access requests. For example, organisations will not be required to provide access to personal data if it is subject to legal professional privilege, or if the disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial information that could harm the competitive position of the organisation. There are also exclusions for access and correction of personal data with respect to any examination conducted by an education institution, examination scripts and examination results prior to their release. Organisations may also refuse access to or refuse to correct opinion data kept solely for an evaluative purpose as defined in the PDPA. The specific exceptions may be found in section 21 and the Fifth Schedule of the  PDPA.\n",

      "FAQ:  Organisations, Collection, Use & Disclosure. Generally, organisations may continue to use the personal data collected prior to the effective date of the data protection rules, unless the individual withdraws consent (if consent had previously been given) or indicates that he does not consent to such use of the personal data.  Consent will need to be obtained if the existing data is to be used for a new purpose different from the purpose for which it was collected, or if the existing data is to be disclosed to another organisation or individual, unless any exception applies. These exceptions are set out in the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules of the PDPA respectively. This includes exceptions catering to certain emergency situations, investigations, publicly available data or where the personal data is used for evaluative purposes.For example, if a company has been using its customer's personal data to provide after-sales customer support prior to the PDPA, it can continue to do so after the PDPA comes into effect, even if it did not obtain consent previously. However, if it now intends to use the same personal data for direct marketing where it had not collected the personal data for this purpose, consent will need to be obtained for such a purpose.

      "FAQ:  Organisations, NRIC Numbers. The PDPC recognises that organisations may wish to collect partial NRIC numbers when other alternatives are not satisfactory. Organisations that collect the last three numerical digits and checksum of the NRIC number (e.g. \"567A\" from the full NRIC number of \"S1234567A\") would not be considered to be collecting the full NRIC number, and therefore not subject to the treatment for NRIC numbers set out in the PDPC's advisory guidelines. For more information on partial NRIC numbers, please refer to the PDPC's Technical Guide to Advisory Guidelines on the Personal Data Protection Act for NRIC and other National identification Numbers.Partial NRIC numbers are, however, considered personal data under the PDPA to the extent that an individual can be identified from the partial NRIC number, or from the number and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access. Organisations that collect partial NRIC numbers must still comply with the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA, such as making reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in their possession or under their control from unauthorised disclosure.\n",

      "FAQ:  Organisations, NRIC Numbers. Yes, the positions taken for the retention of the physical NRIC apply to the retention of other IDs that contain the NRIC number (e.g. driver's licence, passport). This is because the risks associated with the indiscriminate retention of physical NRICs as collateral similarly apply to the retention of other IDs that contain the individuals' NRIC numbers.

Emails and mail delivered by post are not included within the scope of the DNC Registry.Emails are not included within the scope of the DNC Registry as unsolicited emails can be blocked through email filters. They also cause less of a nuisance to delete when received, as compared to telephone calls, SMS and fax messages, which are more difficult for the individual to filter. Furthermore, the Spam Control Act (SCA) helps to complete the framework by setting out requirements in relation to the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages in bulk. Please refer to our FAQ on the SCA to find out more about the differences between the PDPA and the SCA. As for junk mail, there are existing ways for individuals to reduce the volume of such mail, such as through the use of letterboxes with anti-junk mail features. Junk mail may also be less of a nuisance than telephone calls, SMS or MMS messages, or faxes, which are more likely to inconvenience an individual or interrupt his activities.\n",

Under the PDPA, organisations are required to obtain consent for a stated purpose to collect, use or disclose the personal data of an individual, and safeguard such data, unless exceptions apply.In addition, the provisions relating to the DNC Registry in the PDPA allow individuals to opt out of marketing messages (voice calls, SMS/MMS or fax) delivered to a Singapore telephone number.

CORRECT:  The PDPA shall apply to a telemarketing message addressed to a Singapore telephone number where:the sender is present in Singapore when the message is sent; or the recipient of the message is present in Singapore when the message is accessed. If a Singapore organisation outsources the telemarketing function overseas, the Singapore organisation that authorised the sending of the message will need to comply with the DNC provisions and will be responsible for the sending of the message.If both the telemarketing organisation and the organisation which outsourced its telemarketing function are overseas organisations, and the recipient is overseas, the DNC provisions will not apply. For example, an overseas telecom service operator sending messages promoting their cheaper IDD service to Singapore subscribers roaming on the overseas telecom network will not need to check the DNC Registry.\n",

CORRECT:  A business-to-business (B2B) marketing call, SMS/MMS or fax message (B2B marketing message) refers to a marketing message which is sent to an organisation, for any purpose of the receiving organisation.A marketing message sent to an individual acting in a personal or domestic capacitywould not be considered a B2B marketing message, even if the message purports to be for a purpose of an organisation. B2B marketing messages are not within the scope of the DNC Registry.

To be clear, B2B marketing messages may stillbe sent to these registered business numbers if they are for a purpose of the organisation. An individual whose telephone or fax number is used as both a personaland business number may therefore still receive B2B marketing messages that are sent to his telephone or fax number as a business phone number.\n",

      "FAQ:  Organisations, Do Not Call Registry, General, Account Creation, Checking the DNC Registry, Credits. The DNC Registry covers marketing messages sent to Singapore telephone numbers. Emails and mail delivered by post are not included within the scope of the DNC Registry.Emails are not included within the scope of the DNC Registry as unsolicited emails can be blocked through email filters. They also cause less of a nuisance to delete when received, as compared to telephone calls, SMS and fax messages, which are more difficult for the individual to filter. Furthermore, the Spam Control Act (SCA) helps to complete the framework by setting out requirements in relation to the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages in bulk. Please refer to our FAQ on the SCA to find out more about the differences between the PDPA and the SCA. As for junk mail, there are existing ways for individuals to reduce the volume of such mail, such as through the use of letterboxes with anti-junk mail features. Junk mail may also be less of a nuisance than telephone calls, SMS or MMS messages, or faxes, which are more likely to inconvenience an individual or interrupt his activities.\n",
